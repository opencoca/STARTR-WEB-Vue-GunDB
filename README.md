Welcome to Vue-GunDB! This project utilizes GunDB, a distributed graph database, along with Vue.js to create a reactive and collaborative web application. Vue-GunDB allows you to manage a list of items that can be added, deleted, and synchronized in real-time across multiple users. So try it out at https://oyqze.csb.app or have fun and hack away on
[codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/opencoca/Vue-GunDB) or [github.dev](https://github.dev/opencoca/Vue-GunDB/)

## Demo

Try out the [live demo](https://oyqze.csb.app/) to experience the functionality of Vue-GunDB. You can also experiment and contribute to the project using the following platforms:

- [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/opencoca/Vue-GunDB)
- [GitHub.dev](https://github.dev/opencoca/Vue-GunDB)
- [Repl.it](https://repl.it/github/opencoca/Vue-GunDB)

## Features

- Add new items to the list using the input field and the "Add" button.
- Delete items from the list by clicking the "delete" button next to each item.
- Real-time synchronization of the item list across multiple users (Note: The "Sync" button is not functional at the moment and the data only reloads on page load).
- Reactive updates to the item list as changes are made.
